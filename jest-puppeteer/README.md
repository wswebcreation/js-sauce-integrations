# Jest with Puppeteer
This folder contains a simple set up for Jest and Puppeteer.

## Install dependencies
You can install all dependencies by running the following command

    npm install
    
This will install all needed dependencies that are listed in the `package.json`-file

> NOTE: Make sure you are in the folder `jest-puppeteer` when you execute this command

## Run tests locally
You can run the tests on your local machine, the only thing you need to have is Chrome. If you have it you can run this command

    npm run test.local

It will run all tests in *headless*-mode, meaning you will not see a browser starting, but the logs will look like this


```log

```

## Run tests on Sauce Labs
Will follow soon
